## NFT Token Exchange Website

Welcome to our NFT Token Exchange website, built with Next.js! This README file will guide you through the setup and provide essential information to get started with our platform.



## Introduction
Our NFT Token Exchange platform is a decentralized marketplace where users can securely buy, sell, and trade non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Built on Next.js, this web application combines the power of React for a dynamic user interface with server-side rendering for optimal performance.

## Features
* Decentralized Trading: Facilitate peer-to-peer trading of NFTs.
* User Wallet Integration: Connect with popular cryptocurrency wallets for seamless transactions.
* Responsive Design: Ensure a smooth experience across various devices and screen sizes.
* Real-time Updates: Keep users informed with real-time updates on token prices and transactions.
* Robust Security: Implement secure authentication and encryption protocols to safeguard user data.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
